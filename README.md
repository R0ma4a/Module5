This readme is regarding task 2, and the "extra" files/directories in my submission: 

I couldn't get the prompt() command to work without running the npm install prompt-sync command. This installed all the files that aren't this file or the "task#.js" files. 

Otherwise, it is used the same way as shown in lab 5.5.

I assumed I should include these files in the submission.
